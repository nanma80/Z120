An orbit is solved if the permutation of the pieces in the orbit is even. It's considered solved because three-cycles within an orbit are easy to find.

When all 3C orbits are solved, all 2C orbits are automatically solved. Therefore the focus is on 3C orbits.
30 cells move any particular orbit.

There are 60 orbits for 3C. Each orbit has 20 3C pieces.

In an cell centric view, Zome model 
15 orbits pass the core: blue struts
20 orbits pass the extension of vertices from core, between the second layer cells: yellow struts
12 orbits pass the edges between second layer and third layer cells: long red struts
12 orbits pass the edges between third layer and fourth layer cells: short red struts
1 orbit orthogonal to the view. No strut

Intersection between two orbits: (with respect to the orthogonal edges; no strut)
4: 15, blue struts
6: 20, yellow struts
10: 24, long red struts and short red struts
30: 1, the orbit itself

Each cell flip changes the parity of 15 orbits. 
Intersection between two cells: with respect to the core
2: 30, flat cells on the equators
3: 40, third layer cells in the directions of vertices of core
5: 48, second layer and fourth layer cells
15: 2, the cell itself and the antipodal cell

Steps to solve 3C:
(1) Solve everything in the south hemisphere without worrying about parity. North sphere and equator are unsolved.
(2) 

Yellow struts to flip:
Top circle, purple, dark pink, light green
Upper equator, purple, pink, green


Available algorithms:

3C 3-cycle, affecting 4C
3C double rotation
2C pure 3-cycle
