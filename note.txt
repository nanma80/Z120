An orbit is solved if the permutation of the pieces in the orbit is even. It's considered solved because three-cycles within an orbit are easy to find.

When all 3C orbits are solved, all 2C orbits are automatically solved. Therefore the focus is on 3C orbits.
30 cells move any particular orbit.
Intersection between two orbits: 
4: 15, 
6: 20, 
10: 24, 
30: 1, the orbit itself


Each cell flip changes the parity of 15 orbits. 
Intersection between two cells: 
2: 30, 
3: 40, 
5: 48, 
15: 2, the cell itself and the antipodal cell
